### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning steps involved in this project:

- The PROPER function is used to standardize retailer names.
- The short date feature is used to standardize date format.
- Duplicates were eliminated.
- The text ‚ÄúNY‚Äù in the City column was updated to "New York" for consistency.
- The excess spaces in the Product column were trimmed.
- The dollar signs were removed from the Revenue column.

### Insights Based on the Dashboard
- **Revenue and Units Sold:** total revenue generated is approximately $95 million, with 2,016,512 units sold, indicating a high average revenue per unit.
- **Top Retailers:** Sports Direct is the leading retailer, contributing significantly to sales, followed by Foot Locker and West Gear. Amazon, despite being a global e-commerce giant, ranks lower in revenue compared to specialized retailers.
- **Best-Selling Products:** Men's Street Footwear is the top-selling product, closely followed by Women's Apparel and Men's Athletic Footwear. Apparel and footwear dominate the product categories, highlighting customer preferences.
- 	**Cities with Highest Revenue:** Charleston leads the cities in revenue, followed by Portland and Orlando. This signifies that revenue distribution across cities shows a concentration in specific urban areas.
- 	**Purchase Methods:** Most purchases (62%) are made online, suggesting a strong digital presence and consumer preference for e-commerce. In-store purchases account for 30%, while only 8% of transactions are classified as "other."
- 	**Sales Trend:** Revenue trends show peaks in May and December, likely driven by seasonal sales (e.g., summer and holiday shopping). There is a noticeable dip in sales during August, possibly due to reduced consumer spending during that period.

### Recommendations Based on this Analysis

- **Focus on E-commerce Growth:** Expand online marketing and optimize the e-commerce platform to capture the largest purchase segment.
- **Seasonal Promotions:** Implement targeted campaigns in May and December to maximize revenue during peak sales periods.
